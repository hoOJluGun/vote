# ðŸ§ª Deployment Testing

## Testing the Main Application

1. Run the server locally:
   ```bash
   cd link
   npm install
   npm start
   ```

2. Visit http://localhost:8000 in your browser
3. Test API endpoints:
   - http://localhost:8000/api/health
   - http://localhost:8000/api/children
   - http://localhost:8000/api/stats

4. Test voting functionality:
   ```bash
   curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/api/submit-vote -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{"childId": 1}'
   ```

## Testing the Telegram Bot

1. Set environment variables:
   ```bash
   export TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN=your_token_here
   export API_BASE_URL=http://localhost:8000/api
   ```

2. Run the bot:
   ```bash
   cd bot
   npm install
   npm start
   ```

3. Test bot commands in Telegram:
   - `/start`
   - `/help`
   - `/children`
   - `/vote`
   - `/stats`

## Verifying Integration

1. Make sure both the main application and bot are running
2. Vote through the web interface and check if it's reflected in bot statistics
3. Vote through the bot and check if it's reflected in web interface statistics
4. Verify that data is persisted in the file-based database
